# GachaSim
Learner project for studying React Native and mobile gacha game design principles. Aims to grow skills in mobile development, algorithms, and full stack development. 

# Tools
ReactNative, OpenWeather, Translink Skytrain trip table, Firebase, Firestore

# Premise
To-do list app where tasks are linked to timers that block distracting apps using respective platform's blacklisters (e.g. iOS Focus). Habit-forming is 
encouraged by interleaving gacha design, which also provides a tangible, visual form of progress to users. Parsing Translink's trip tables will demonstrate algorithm design, as well
as provide a sense of familiarity to users in Metro Vancouver. Inspired by the productivity app "Forest," developed by SEEKRTECH CO.
