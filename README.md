# Skytrainer

Cut down screen time and build productive routines. Skytrainer helps you set personalized daily tasks and uses habit-forming design principles to help you complete them, everyday.

Plan your own daily tasks. When triggered, your phone goes on a Focus Trip and blocks distracting apps as it Skytrains through the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Stay productive to the end of the trip duration and you'll be rewarded. A depth-first search algorithm uses Translink's real world Skytrain data to simulate an actual trip that takes as long as your daily task.

# Background
Skytrainer is a mobile productivity helper app where devices will disable distracting apps to help users go on "Focus Trips." Simply set a trip timer and your device will go on a Skytrain journey, accumulating in-app rewards along the way to encourage longer Focus Trips. Rewards can be used to purchase Skytrain Stations that will all have custom commissioned artwork. By applying the habit-forming mobile gacha game design principles, the app can help users build positive habits and intrinsic discipline towards a better life.
With the beauty of React Native, the app can help even more users build better habits since it can be used on Android or iOS devices.

Productivity tasks are linked to timers that block distracting apps using respective platform's blocklists (e.g. iOS Focus). Habit-forming is
encouraged by interleaving gacha design, and Station collections provides a tangible, visual form of progress to users. Rewards are in the form of character art and
upgrade materials. Using Translink's Skytrains allowed demonstration of a highly-tailored graph traversal algorithm that could produce a Skytrain
trip when given a trip duration. Using the Skytrain system also provides a sense of familiarity to users in Metro Vancouver. By querying gacha data from the SQL database,
new gacha content and Stations can be injected into the app without a single update on the user side.

Inspired by the productivity app "Forest," developed by SEEKRTECH CO.
